* Why I'm back on Arch
Spent close to a year in NixOS. It was honestly a lot of fun, Nix is a cool playground to learn new tools and build a deep configuration.

But over time, I've also noticed growing pains that come with using Nix(OS) as your daily driver desktop distro.

Issues mainly stemming from it not respecting traditional Linux FHS standards, software needing to be configured in a blend of home-manager
and classic configuration formats, config changes not reflecting until you rebuild your system or HM config, and more.

As it turns out, Arch Linux has a way to be enticing enough that you never truly escape it :3
